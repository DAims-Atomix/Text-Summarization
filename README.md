# Article Summarizer

Welcome to the **Article Summarizer** application! This project is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and uses the [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library to summarize text or web articles. The application allows you to input text or a URL and get a summarized version of the content.
